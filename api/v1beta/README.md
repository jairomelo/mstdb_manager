# V1beta API - DEPRECATED AND REMOVED

## Status: ‚ùå **REMOVED** (October 2025)

This directory contains the deprecated V1beta API that has been removed from the application.

## Reason for Removal
- V1beta was an experimental version
- No applications were using these endpoints
- Simplified API structure by removing unused code

## Replacement
V1beta functionality has been superseded by:
- **V1**: Stable API for existing applications
- **V2**: Performance-optimized API for new features

## Files in this directory
These files are kept for reference only and are not loaded by the application:
- `serializers.py` - V1beta serializers (unused)
- `views.py` - V1beta views (unused)

## Migration
No migration is needed since V1beta was not in use.

See `/API_MIGRATION.md` for complete details about API changes.
